## Data Governance

The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board is committed to ensuring data-driven policy making that best supports our participants and beneficiaries as required by Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA), the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policy Making Act of 2018 (Evidence Act), and other related statutes.

The FRTIB has established a Data Governance Policy which provides a framework to structure decisions about how the FRTIB will collect, use, structure, retain, and share data, and ensure that business or IT related initiatives have been reviewed by subject matter experts relative to the impact those initiatives may have on our data environment. This policy establishes a data governance body whose membership is defined therein.

Alex Podpaly is the FRTIBâ€™s Chief Data and AI Officer. He can be reached at <alex.podpaly@frtib.gov> or 202-942-1600.
