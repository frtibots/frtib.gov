## Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board Compliance Plan for OMB Memoranda M-24-10 – 09/2024

### Prepared by Alex Podpaly, Chief AI Officer  

Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) will comply with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) M-24-10 memorandum.  If Artificial Intelligence technology (AI) is implemented responsibly, it can improve efficiencies and deliver better service to the American public. Like any power and useful tools, AI requires understanding of its risks, its potential of abuse and limitations.  Therefore, it is important to FRTIB to comply with the OMB directive as it outlines the necessary roadmap, framework and guidance toward successful AI deployment at FRTIB.  Compliance with M-24-10 also signifies a significant step toward responsible AI implementation in FRTIB’s agency operations. It emphasizes transparency, accountability, and risk management to safeguard the participants & beneficiaries’ rights and safety.

#### STRENGTHENING AI GOVERNANCE
FRTIB’s AI governance body Information Security Governance Committee (ISGC) comprised of subject matter experts and senior leaders from Office of Planning and Risk, along with Office of Technology Services, Office of General Counsel and Office of Resource Management.  The AI governing body plans to consult NIST Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) and to collaborate on NIST AI Risk Management Framework implementation to strength AI governance.

#### ADVANCING RESPONSIBLE AI INNOVATION
As a key pillar of FRTIB’s AI Strategy, FRTIB plans to leverage the NIST’s framework to map, measure and implement AI services responsibly and remove possible barriers that impedes progress and safeguard GenAI technology from misuse and abuse.  Furthermore, FRTIB will leverage existing new IT product and service intake governance process to identify innovative AI uses and work together with other internal governance bodies to ensure responsible AI use.
FRTIB is also working toward increasing its AI talents through increase employee awareness, upskilling and training.

#### MANAGING RISKS FROM THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Managing risks associated with AI is FRTIB’s top enterprise risk management priority.  Using the NIST AI RMF as guide, the agency is focusing on developing an AI strategy, building out policies, procedures and set of controls to mitigate risks and provide a guardrail to prevent abuse.  These tools will be put in place to ensure safe and reasonable AI deployments and use at FRTIB.  FRTIB will adopt industry standards and established internal software lifecycle procedures to evaluate, implement, maintain and sunset AI systems safely and responsibly.  GenAI use at FRTIB will be audited and subject to periodic reviews to ensure that the public’s safety and rights are not compromised and appropriate measures are meaningful to bring non-compliance systems to back to compliant state or to terminate its use.
