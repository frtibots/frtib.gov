## Fair Chance to Compete

The Fair Chance to Compete for Jobs Act prohibits the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board from requesting an applicant's criminal history record before that individual receives a conditional offer of employment. 
In accordance with 5 U.S. Code § 9202(c) and 5 C.F.R § 920.201 certain positions are exempt from the provisions of the Fair Chance to Compete Act. 
Applicants who believe they have been subjected to a violation of the Fair Chance to Compete for Jobs Act, may submit a written complaint to HumanResourcesDivision@FRTIB.GOV.

FRTIB employees, former employees, and applicants for employment are protected under various laws from discrimination in hiring, promotion, removal, benefits, job training, classification, referral, and other aspects of employment, and have a right to file an complaint if they believe they have been discriminated against on the basis of Fair Chance to Compete Act.
